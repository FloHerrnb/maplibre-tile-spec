 * FSST: Fast Static Symbol Table compression 
 * see the paper https://github.com/cwida/fsst/raw/master/fsstcompression.pdf
 *
 * FSST is a compression scheme focused on string/text data: it can compress strings from distributions with many different values (i.e.
 * where dictionary compression will not work well). It allows *random-access* to compressed data: it is not block-based, so individual
 * strings can be decompressed without touching the surrounding data in a compressed block. When compared to e.g. lz4 (which is 
 * block-based), FSST achieves similar decompression speed, (2x) better compression speed and 30% better compression ratio on text.
 *
 * FSST encodes strings also using a symbol table -- but it works on pieces of the string, as it maps "symbols" (1-8 byte sequences) 
 * onto "codes" (single-bytes). FSST can also represent a byte as an exception (255 followed by the original byte). Hence, compression 
 * transforms a sequence of bytes into a (supposedly shorter) sequence of codes or escaped bytes. These shorter byte-sequences could 
 * be seen as strings again and fit in whatever your program is that manipulates strings.
 *
 * useful property: FSST ensures that strings that are equal, are also equal in their compressed form.
 * 
 * In this API, strings are considered byte-arrays (byte = unsigned char) and a batch of strings is represented as an array of 
 * unsigned char* pointers to their starts. A seperate length array (of unsigned int) denotes how many bytes each string consists of. 
 *
 * This representation as unsigned char* pointers tries to assume as little as possible on the memory management of the program
 * that calls this API, and is also intended to allow passing strings into this API without copying (even if you use C++ strings).
 *
 * We optionally support C-style zero-terminated strings (zero appearing only at the end). In this case, the compressed strings are 
 * also zero-terminated strings. In zero-terminated mode, the zero-byte at the end *is* counted in the string byte-length.
